# Victory is mine says the lord
I shall be like a tree planted by the riverside which yeild it's fruits in season

## The lord is kind and mecriful
The Lord is my light and salvation

## I am free in Jesus name
i 

## I am saved by power
He will never leave or forsake you




## Awesome Lord


## The Lord is my Sherperd I shall not want
he make me lye in green pasture
